                <h2>Research</h2>

        
        <p>My research is focused on <strong>improving human performance in machine systems</strong>. I really enjoy Donald Norman’s vision for <a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/invisible-computer"><em>The Invisible Computer</em></a>. If the operator notices their computer, the designer has failed. This should apply broadly to all human-machine teaming. Machines exist solely to augment human performance, but we are often confused by their designs. Let’s work to better understand this relationship between human and machine, developing an improved user experience along the way. Outcomes are especially geared towards <strong>reducing operator error in safety critical systems</strong>.</p>

        <p>Currently, I support the <a href="https://morpheuslab.engr.tamu.edu/">Morpheus Lab</a>, where we believe solving the <strong>autonomy conundrum</strong> is the crucial step towards successfully deploying autonomous vehicles. As automation increases, situational awareness of the human operator <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0018720816681350"><strong>decreases</strong></a>. Decreased situational awareness leads to reduced response time when the system makes an error. Current autonomous systems suffer from <strong>poor transparency</strong>, further decreasing situational awareness. There have been a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/new-software-in-boeing-737-max-planes-under-scrutinty-after-second-crash/2019/03/13/06716fda-45c7-11e9-90f0-0ccfeec87a61_story.html?utm_term=.7343bcc47282">number</a> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/technology/uber-self-driving-car-arizona.html">of</a> <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/tesla-autopilot-self-driving-crash-california/">very</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-autopilot-car-gets-confused-and-crashes-on-highway/">public</a> <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2013/10/16/the-forgotten-story-of-iran-air-flight-655/?utm_term=.c27d9da85c00">accidents</a> resulting from this conundrum, which are damaging to public trust in these systems. <strong>Stability</strong> is the measure of our future autonomous systems.</p>
        
        <p>I believe <strong>improving system awareness</strong> of the operator is a novel solution to this problem. Cognitive modeling, which seeks to robustly measure operator <em>state</em> can provide the autonomous system with the necessary information to keep the operator in the loop. If the system can measure the operator, it can manage their situation awareness in real time. I am particularly interested in <strong>quantum cognitive modeling</strong>, which quantifies the uncertainty of the operator state using well understood quantum principles. A successful implementation of this vision would see an autonomous vehicle that can measure the operator state in real time and encourage the operator to <strong>collapse</strong> to a desired state, such as engaged.</p>
        
        <p>Along the way, I have become interested in different tools for measuring human systems. Motion capture offers some particularly unique capabilities, which I have become very familiar with at the <a href="https://starlab.engr.tamu.edu/">RELLIS Starlab Facility</a>. The human operator is becoming increasingly available as a design factor, so I’m excited to grow with the challenge.</p>
