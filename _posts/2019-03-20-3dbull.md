Every Mother's Day, I try and create something that's totally original. Blending a little science with art lowers the barrier of entry for me, and I'm really happy with the way this one turned out. 

We are pretty connected to the family farm (shameless plug for [***Brad Z Ranch***](https://bradzranch.wordpress.com/)) and [agriculture in general](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LRIlPIaStPc), and I love those low poly animals online.

At the start of this project, I wasn't even sure how you would 3D print one of these animals. I also procrastinated long enough that I wasn't able to prototype the design before I sent it. I think the lesson here is that good design overcomes the need for testing. Right? :grimacing: I set out to build a similar model of a bull. Sounds easier than a bird. I started working in Blender because of its flexibility. As always, it helps to start with a good outline.

From there, it only takes hours of shaping to get a nice 2D form of the bull.

The side image isn't helpful for extruding the bull in the final direction to give it width, so that part ended up being a lot of guess and check. I was really happy with Blender's capability to add and merge lines, points, and other features.

Looks like a bull! Legs and head were particularly tricky to get the proportions right on. I was tempted to print the solid model and call it, but I decided on a wireframe cause it's pretty. Fortunately, this software has that feature built in. Handy, but I made a classic rookie mistake. I was too picky with the shape of the bull, it was too fine to print structurally. The model resolution is too high for printing as is.

</figure>
These wires are too thin! Again, I'm lucky because the software has a feature to reduce the number of vertexes in the solid, while maintaining the same average shape across the body. We've lost a bit of definition, but still clearly a bull.

Much better. Likely that this frame will hold up during production and shipping. He might be a little over-designed :muscle:. Perhaps I can iterate in the future.  Now the hard part is getting it from the computer to my parents house. Traditional 3D plastic printers go layer by layer to leave only the right amount of plastic in each place. Smarter people typically design supports into their designs so that the hot plastic won't sag under its own weight. 

But I don't want to do all that work. Plus you have to cut and sand the supports off at the end. Fortunately, [ShapeWays](https://www.shapeways.com/) has technology that limits the need for support structures. Instead of laying each layer of plastic, their printers lay a whole rectangle of plastic. The plastic is like flour, granular and light. Then they run a laser over the parts that I want to turn solid, which instantly melts the plastic together in just the right places. Then another layer of plastic dust and laser again, millimeters at a time. Since there is melted plastic all around the final design, there is no need for supports! Then at the end, technicians blow away all the loose dust. 

Like I said, I didn't leave enough time to ship a prototype before Mother's Day. [Sometimes you gotta lick the stamp and send it.](https://streamable.com/pbmq9) Turns out, it's better to be lucky than good. :ok_hand:

Obviously, super pleased with the way this turned out: 
1. He stands on his own 4 legs
2. He didn't break in shipping
3. The person who had to print it at Shapeways thinks I know what I'm doing

I think the center part of the ven diagram comparing people who are interested in bulls and people who are interested in 3D printing is probably very small. Happy Mother's Day!
